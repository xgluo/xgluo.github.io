## About Me

I am a PhD candidate working with [Prof. Niko Beerenwinkel](https://bsse.ethz.ch/cbg/group/people/person-detail.MTQ5NDE3.TGlzdC81MTYsOTQ0ODM3Mzc2.html) at the [Computational Biology Group](https://bsse.ethz.ch/cbg) at D-BSSE, ETH Zurich. My research lies at the intersection of mathematics, statistics, and computational biology. Currently I focus on modeling cancer evolution using tumor phylogenetic trees and developing novel methods for inferring reproducible features, such as exclusivity patterns, recurrent trajectories, and fitness landscapes, across different patients.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics at the University of Waterloo in Canada, followed by a Master of Science in Statistics at ETH Zurich. During my master thesis with [Dr. Jack Kuipers](https://bsse.ethz.ch/cbg/group/people/person-detail.MjA3Mjc0.TGlzdC81MTYsOTQ0ODM3Mzc2.html), I developed a strong interest in probabilistic models, including Bayesian networks, and their applications to biology in general.
